Project Description:

This Project uses an MVC package structure. We have done some initial coding for
our Model package including the basic classes for attractions, restaurants,
shows, foodstands, food orders, reservations, and an itinerary of reservations.

We have also coded some preliminary classes in the View package that will hold 
the logic for our GUI. We also have some preliminary controller classes that 
have methods to perform operations on Lists that hold reservations, with more 
methods for handling application operations later.

All but the view classes and methods include JavaDocs.
